I am co-founder and CEO of [Deeptrace](https://www.deeptracelabs.com), where we develop technology for detecting and monitoring misuses of synthetic media, aka ["deepfakes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake). To know more watch this interview for [Defenders of Digital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBBMT_DvjqI) from our [Amsterdam office](https://storage.googleapis.com/tq-site-assets/general/featured-image-tq-building.jpg).

My team's work has been covered by [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/07/tech/deepfake-videos-increase/index.html), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49961089), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them), [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/4183b400-f960-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloombergquint.com/technology/how-deepfakes-make-disinformation-more-real-than-ever-quicktake), [Wired](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepfakes-porn), [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2019/10/07/porn-to-scams-deepfakes-big-racket-unnerving-business-leaders-and-lawmakers/), and [Al Jazheera](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2019/12/politics-porn-toxic-world-deepfake-191215101055666.html) (TV). Check out our latest report on [The State of Deepfakes](https://www.deeptracelabs.com/resources) (Oct 19).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher working on deep learning with [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/) at the University of Amsterdam. I built privacy-preserving distributed machine learning systems at [Data61 CSIRO](http://www.data61.csiro.au), part of the Australian federal government.
I defended my PhD at the Australian National University, advised by
[Richard Nock](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rnock/) and
[Tiberio Caetano](http://www.tiberiocaetano.com). My thesis was on weakly supervised learning, privacy and deep learning.
I received my BSc and MSc from Milan Polytechnic with a thesis on Nash equilibrium computation.

In 2012 co-founded [Waynaut](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisoncoleman/2015/01/11/how-an-entrepreneurs-college-commute-inspired-an-italian-one-click-travel-start-up), an Internet mobility startup which was acquired by Lastminute.com.
