I am a PhD student on Machine Learning at the
[Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au) with
[NICTA](https://www.nicta.com.au), advised by
[Richard Nock](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=0J2s3YQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and
[Tiberio Caetano](http://www.tiberiocaetano.com). My research is about
weakly supervision, *i.e.* any setting in the continuum between supervised and
unsupervised learning. In particular, I am interested in cases when supervision is given by information
aggregated over subsets of examples or corrupted by noise. The setting has connections with topics in privacy, distributed data and social sciences.

Prior to moving to Australia, I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. from Politecnico di Milan with
a research thesis on Nash Equilibrium computation in Game Theory working with
[Nicola Gatti](http://home.deib.polimi.it/ngatti/Nicola_Gatti__Homepage.html).

I like startups. I co-founded [Waynaut](http://www.waynaut.com), among the few companies
*turning up the heat* ([Forbes](http://lnkd.in/d3UGMsx)) of the Italian tech startup environment.
