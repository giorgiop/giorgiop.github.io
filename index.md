I am a PhD student on Machine Learning at the
[Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au) with
[CSIRO Data61](http://www.data61.csiro.au)
(formerly known as [NICTA](https://www.nicta.com.au)), advised by
[Richard Nock](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=0J2s3YQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and
[Tiberio Caetano](http://www.tiberiocaetano.com). My research is about
weak supervision, i.e. any learning problem in the continuum between supervised and
unsupervised learning. In particular, I study scenarios where supervision is given by high-level aggregated statistics or corrupted by noise; I also work on topics of learning theory, privacy, distributed data and deep learning.

Prior to moving to Australia, I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. from Politecnico di Milan with
a research thesis on Nash Equilibrium computation working with
[Nicola Gatti](http://home.deib.polimi.it/ngatti/Nicola_Gatti__Homepage.html).

I like startups. I co-founded [Waynaut](http://www.waynaut.com), among the few companies
*turning up the heat* ([Forbes](http://lnkd.in/d3UGMsx)) of the Italian tech startup environment.
