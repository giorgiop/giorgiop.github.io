I am Cofounder and CEO at [Sensity](https://www.sensity.ai), formerly called Deeptrace, an AI security startup detecting and monitoring online visual threats such as ["deepfakes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake). To know more watch this interview for [Defenders of Digital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBBMT_DvjqI).

My team's work has been covered by [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/07/tech/deepfake-videos-increase/index.html), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49961089), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/20/deep-fake-nudes/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them), [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/4183b400-f960-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloombergquint.com/technology/how-deepfakes-make-disinformation-more-real-than-ever-quicktake), [Wired](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepfakes-porn), [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/telegram-deepfake-nude-women-images-bot), [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2019/10/07/porn-to-scams-deepfakes-big-racket-unnerving-business-leaders-and-lawmakers/), [Al Jazheera](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2019/12/politics-porn-toxic-world-deepfake-191215101055666.html) (TV), [Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHCrf2-x6w) (with 700k+ views on YouTube), and [Infotagion](https://infotagion.com/podcast/episode-33-nina-schick-and-giorgio-patrini/) (podcast by British MP Damian Collins).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher working on deep generative models with [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/) at the University of Amsterdam. I built privacy-preserving distributed machine learning systems at [Data61](http://www.data61.csiro.au), part of the Australian Federal Government.
I defended my PhD at the Australian National University, advised by
[Richard Nock](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rnock/) and
[Tiberio Caetano](http://www.tiberiocaetano.com). My thesis was on weakly supervised (deep) learning and privacy. I received my BSc and MSc from Milan Polytechnic with a thesis on Nash equilibrium computation. Yes, I am still on [GScholar](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=OilV7WMAAAAJ&hl=en).

In 2012 I co-founded [Waynaut](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisoncoleman/2015/01/11/how-an-entrepreneurs-college-commute-inspired-an-italian-one-click-travel-start-up), a mobility startup acquired by Lastminute.com.
