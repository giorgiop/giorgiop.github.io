*For UvA Master students: drop me an e-mail if you are looking for projects on
machine learning/deep learning.*

<br>

I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/) at the [DELTA Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/) (Deep Learning Technologies Amsterdam), a joint effort of the University of Amsterdam and Bosch, where we focus on fundamental research in deep learning and vision.

Previously, I worked on distributed machine learning and privacy at  [N1analytics](http://www.n1analytics.com), part of [Data61 CSIRO](http://www.data61.csiro.au).
I completed my PhD in machine learning at the
[Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au) with [NICTA](https://www.nicta.com.au), advised by
[Richard Nock](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rnock/) and
[Tiberio Caetano](http://www.tiberiocaetano.com). My thesis was about
weakly supervised learning, *e.g.* labels corrupted by noise or by high-level aggregation, touching on learning theory, privacy and deep learning.
I received my BSc and MSc from Polytechnic University of Milan with
a thesis on Nash equilibrium computation with [Nicola Gatti](http://www.gametheory.polimi.it/nicola-gatti.html).

I co-founded [Waynaut](http://www.waynaut.com), among the few companies
*turning up the heat* ([Forbes](http://lnkd.in/d3UGMsx)) of the Italian startup scene. Waynaut was acquired by lastminute.com group in 2017.
