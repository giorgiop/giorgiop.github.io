Now on a new venture: [Deeptrace](https://www.deeptracelabs.com). Featured on [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/will-deepfakes-detection-be-ready-for-2020): *Startup Deeptrace is racing to develop automated detection of fake videos and images as U.S. 2020 elections loom*.

I have been included in the Defenders of Digital.

Previously, I was a postdoc researcher working on deep learning with [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/) at the [DELTA Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/), University of Amsterdam. I built privacy-preserving distributed machine learning systems at [Data61 CSIRO](http://www.data61.csiro.au), part of the Australian federal government.
I defended my PhD at the Australian National University with [NICTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NICTA), advised by
[Richard Nock](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rnock/) and
[Tiberio Caetano](http://www.tiberiocaetano.com). My thesis was on weakly supervised learning, learning theory, privacy and deep learning.
I received my BSc and MSc from Milan Polytechnic with
a thesis on Nash equilibrium computation with [Nicola Gatti](http://www.gametheory.polimi.it/nicola-gatti.html).

In 2012 co-founded [Waynaut](http://www.waynaut.com), among the few companies
*turning up the heat* ([Forbes](http://lnkd.in/d3UGMsx)) of the Italian startup scene. Waynaut was acquired by lastminute.com group in 2017.
