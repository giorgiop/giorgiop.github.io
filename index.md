I do research and engineering at [CSIRO Data61](http://www.data61.csiro.au) on
topics of machine learning and privacy in the [N1](http://www.n1analytics.com) team.

I completed my PhD on machine learning at the
[Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au) with [NICTA](https://www.nicta.com.au), advised by
[Richard Nock](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rnock/) and
[Tiberio Caetano](http://www.tiberiocaetano.com). My thesis was about
weak supervision, i.e. any learning problem in the continuum between supervised and
unsupervised learning. In particular, I studied scenarios where supervision is given by high-level aggregated statistics or corrupted by noise; I also touched on learning theory, privacy, distributed data and deep learning.

Prior to moving to Australia, I received my BSc and MSc from Politecnico di Milano with
a research thesis on Nash equilibrium computation working with
[Nicola Gatti](http://home.deib.polimi.it/ngatti/Nicola_Gatti__Homepage.html).

I like startups. I co-founded and advice [Waynaut](http://www.waynaut.com), among the few companies
*turning up the heat* ([Forbes](http://lnkd.in/d3UGMsx)) of the Italian startup environment.
